# Summary
This data file will be helpful for the researchers who are working on the issue of soil-structure interaction. The data presented in the file are used to plot figures in the paper titled “Metaheuristic model for the interface shear strength between granular soil and structure considering surface morphology” in Computer and Geotechnics. These data are classified into five parts: amplitude parameters, spacing parameters, hybrid parameters, material ratio curves and related parameters, and peak parameters. For further reference, please refer to Chen et al. (2021).
