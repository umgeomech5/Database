# Summary

## 
This program contains processed segment data for the paper “High-temporal-resolution ERT characterization for vegetation effects on soil hydrological response under wet-dry cycles”. The data is used to evalutate the soil response of a slope site. RP1-RP4 refers to ERT data for four rain periods. The code is written for Python 3.8.8.
